# Raspberry Pi

This is for the 2025 season.

The full raspberry pi project is in studies.

This is pared down, just what we need for 2025 comps.

I removed the parts that we're not going to use in 2025:

* Network tables gyro (the Redux gyro works fine)
* GTSAM (needs more offseason development)
* network support for GTSAM, including tag corners and camera calibration
* kinodynamics (used for GTSAM odometry)

I left the logging listener in, since I'm not yet sure if we need it.

See the __doc__ directory for more documentation.

Team 100 uses Raspberry Pis for coprocessing, with several different workloads:

* AprilTag vision
* Game piece vision
* Friend/foe vision
* Logging UDP listener

All these different workloads use the same deployed artifact, built out of this directory,
using the board identity to select behavior.

The key is that python can load modules out of zip files, so you zip up the source directory
and upload it. There's also a very short python script, runapp.py, that runs the zip
file -- you just upload this one time.

# How to install python support in vscode

If you get a lot of import errors, your environment isn't set up correctly.

In linux:

```
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages opencv-python
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages robotpy
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages robotpy-apriltag
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages robotpy-cscore

python3 -m pip install numpy
python3 -m pip install wpilib
```

Vscode may ask about creating a virtual environment, since you are "breaking system packages."
After briefly cursing the sad state of python packaging and dependency management,
you should decline the offer: don't use a virtual environment, these are not system packages.

You may want to reload the python environment, which is only possible using the "command palette"
(ctrl-shift-P) and finding "python: clear cache and reload window". 

# How to run locally

From the command line in the raspberry_pi directory:

```
python3 runapp.py
```

Then look at http://localhost:1181/

And you should see the test image being processed over and over.


# How to deploy

Install the vscode Gradle extension (from Microsoft). It will make available a Gradle "activity" which includes the task "distribution/distZip". Click the little play button, and it will produce a "zip" file containing the "app" code. To make it easier to find, you can "pin" the task.

Find the zip file in build/distributions/app.zip. Upload it to the RPi, next to runapp.py.

# How to run the tests

There are two ways to run the tests:

Install the vscode python extension, and a little Erlenmeyer flask will appear in the toolbar on the left; this scans the source tree for test methods, and makes a little list of them.  You can run all of them, or individual ones.

The same extension also puts a little marker in the file editor, on the left side of each test method, and provides test output there too, in case of failures.

You can also run all the tests from the command line from the raspberry_pi directory:

```
python3 runtests.py
```
