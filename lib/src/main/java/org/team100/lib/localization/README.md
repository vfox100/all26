# lib.localization

This package uses two sources of position data
to determine the robot's global pose:

## Odometry

At each time step, the difference in wheel positions since the previous
time step is used to compute a difference in pose, using forward kinematics.
Obviously odometry can only estimate pose differences, not absolute pose.
See `OdometryUpdater`.

## Vision

Each camera publishes relative poses of AprilTags it can see (`Blips), and
these are received by `AprilTagRobotLocalizer`, which transforms each one into
a global pose estimate, using its knowledge of each camera pose relative to the
robot (see `Camera`), and each tag relative to the field
(see `AprilTagFieldLayoutWithCorrectOrientation`).

The main complexity here is __accommodating delay.__  Camera input is delayed between
around 75 and 100 ms, and so it can't be used to directly adjust the robot's __current__ pose
estimate.  Instead, we apply camera input to __old__ pose estimates, recorded by
`SwerveHistory`, and then __replay__ the subsequent odometry differentials to get
the current pose.

The camera input doesn't completely override the old estimate, we use a weighted
average (see `NudgingVisionUpdater`).  The weights can be adjusted for every update,
typically we weigh the vision less when the tag is far away.

Another important subtlety is that when we transform camera-relative tag sightings
into robot pose estimates, we don't use the rotational component of the tag sighting,
we use the `Gyro` reading instead, because the gyro is more accurate.  But this does
mean that the vision system is dependent on the gyro: if the gyro zero is wrong,
then the vision will be confused.  Also the gyro does drift (about 2 millirad/s)
so you'll have to reset the robot rotation periodically, and the gyro, like every
sensor, includes noise(about 0.05 rad for
[the gyro we use](https://docs.reduxrobotics.com/canandgyro/performance)).
Thus, far-away tag sightings combined
with rotational noise can produce translational error, around 5 percent
of the tag distance.  So for a tag 2 meters away, a translational estimate could
be off by 10 cm due to gyro noise alone, which is a large error!  This is one
of the reasons we use a weighted average for vision updates: it acts as a
low-pass filter.

## Global vs Local Localizers

Some other teams (6328) use different methods for "local" localization (relative
to a specific tag for a specific task), and "global" localization (combining
inputs from multiple tags).  We don't do that, but we do allow the parameters
in the pose estimator to be changed by commands, so when you want the estimator
to ignore far-away tags, use `AprilTagRobotLocalizer.setHeedRadiusM()`.
