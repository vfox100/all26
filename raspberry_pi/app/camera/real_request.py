        # the requested (buffer_count) number of dma buffers, which
        # are mmap.mmap objects, which are Buffers.

        # The camera uses DmaAllocator, whose sync property
        # is the DmaSync constructor.
        #
        # The _MappedBuffer constructor invokes the DmaSync constructor
        # to get a DmaSync.  _MappedBuffer.__enter__() delegates to DmaSync to
        # do the ioctl DMA_BUF_SYNC_START (again), and return the mmap.
        #
        # _MappedBuffer.__exit__() also delegates to DmaSync, which implements
        # DMA_BUF_SYNC_END.
        #
        # since _MappedBuffer implements __enter__ and __exit__, we
        # can duck-type it an AbstractContextManager.

        # not be touched anymore, which means not using numpy views on it.

        # (it's done by the CompletedRequest), but using _MappedBuffer is, by far,
        # the easiest way to get at the mmap buffer.
