# Raspberry Pi Docs

## Overview

We use Raspberry Pi 5's as "smart cameras", looking at each
frame captured and extracting things the robot cares about:

* Poses of nearby AprilTags
* Bearings to nearby game pieces

The main libraries we use are

* [AprilTag](https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag) -- a umich project from 2011, revised a few times since then.
* [OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) -- an Intel project from 1999, expanded many times since then.
* [robotpy](https://github.com/robotpy) a port of WPILib to python.

The architecture is very simple:

* A main loop
* A camera captures a frame
* One or two analyzers look at it
* Results are sent over the network

There are a few interesting details:

* To keep the Pi and RoboRIO clocks in sync, we use the 
  [Team 100 "sync" protocol](https://github.com/team100/all26/blob/main/lib/src/main/java/org/team100/lib/network/SYNC.md)
  * The reason we care about the clocks is because we care about exact
    timing of each captured frame: the camera system latency is
    much more than the robot update periodicity, so the robot needs to
    be careful about handling the "delayed" input.
* For many types, we use python `Protocol` with a few
  implementations, e.g. a "fake" camera for testing.
* We run the same code everywhere, so we use the Raspberry Pi
  serial number to select implemenations and capabilities.
* We have our own deployment and management method.

We use simple bespoke code, rather than some FRC vision
thing like Limelight or PhotonVision, to encourage the
students to develop
[agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy))
to understand and modify their own tools.
These are not complex systems, they should not be
magic black boxes.
